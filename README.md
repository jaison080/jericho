## Problem Statement

Nowadays itâ€™s very hard to find an architect who is truly inspired by the aesthetic virtue of customers, itâ€™s more like a trial and error procedure until we find the right one that suits our aesthetic sense. So what if there is a platform that can make this tedious task simple. Our platform envision easier and faster access to architects and plans for the customerâ€™s dream home.Users can choose from a variety of different options can see the previous works they had done, architects get tagged or will be provided with badges according to their expertise in each type of construction so that if a user needs a house that is derived from the ancient traditional qualities he can make this his preference and choose accordingly. Rates of each architects will also be displayed and if user provide images of land as well as mention his needs they will be getting an initial design.


## Problem Solution

ArchX will be the first ever platform which is dedicated for architect hiring and consultation facilities. People can choose architects based on their rates and images of previous works made available through their profile on our platform. Architects can auction their patented designs as well as multiple architects can be hired by the users to work collaboratively on a project which are going to be our unique selling points. Users need to upload the images of land provide a brief description regarding their needs and measures to get first time plan for their dream home. We will be providing a handle that enables users to purchase selected building accessories and fitments. We will be having sponsored ads of products and architects in our platform followed by the income generated as part of booking fitments and other accessories. Patented ideas or designs can be auctioned among users. Users can use our platfrom so that they can easily choose the right architect for their projects. We are focusing on making this hassle free and efficient way of hiring architects.
